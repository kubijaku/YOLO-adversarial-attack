# APP-YOLO-attack

## Overview

The aim of the project is to implement **adversarial attack** against YOLO-based object detectors using Untargeted **FGSM** (Fast Gradient Sign Method). 

Moreover, it evalutaion of confusion matrix's will be conducted for the validation dataset before and after attack.

The goal is to generate visually small perturbations that are hardly recognizable for a human and significantly reduce detection accuracy.
